# Hackathon2025
AgriLink: A Collaboration and Diagnostic Platform for Agriculture I. Context: In the midst of a major digital transformation in the agricultural sector, farmers are in need of new digital solutions to help them solve their daily problems. This project aims to develop a mobile application that will enable farmers to consult with each other and quickly diagnose plant diseases.

II. Main Objective: Develop a mobile application that will enable farmers to exchange advice and experiences, identify plant diseases affecting their crops, and help them improve production and reduce losses.

III. Required Functions:

Basic Level (Required): Farmer Network: Personal Profile: Each farmer creates a profile with their GPS location and other information.

Interactive Map: Displays the locations of nearby farmers.

Consultation Service: Send a consultation request to other nearby farmers.

Instruction Manual: A short guide explaining how to use the application.

Plant Disease Diagnosis: Photographing and Uploading: The farmer photographs the diseased plant and uploads the image to the app.

Automatic Analysis: Identify diseases (at least 3 to 5 diseases using a smart API).

Share Discoveries: Share images and results with other farmers for consultation.

Advanced Level: Advanced Information: Crop History and Yield Analysis.

Rating System: Rate recommendations (from 1 to 5 stars) based on quality and usefulness.

IV. Technical Limitations: The app must be compatible with mobile devices (Android is preferred).

A user-friendly interface for farmers.

The app must be available in offline mode.

Disease identification must be compatible with at least 3 important crop types.

Photography must be clear and accurate.

V. Expected Stages: Release of a first version with the basics.

Clean and clear code.

Live demonstration of the app before the committee.
